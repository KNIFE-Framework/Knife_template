# 🧠 KNIFE Template

Welcome to the **KNIFE Template** — your structured starting point for creating and sharing knowledge using the **KNIFE framework**.

---

## ❓ What is KNIFE?

**KNIFE** (Knowledge IN Friendly Examples) is a simple framework to:
- Share practical knowledge and experience.
- Document solutions in structured and reusable format.
- Enable contributions from both technical and non-technical users.

---

## 🎯 Why use the KNIFE Template?

This template helps you:
- Create a public or private knowledge artifact (e.g., KNIFE044 - Backup OneDrive).
- Follow a repeatable documentation structure.
- Publish your content easily via GitHub Pages or Docusaurus.

---

## 🧩 Template Structure

Each knowledge contribution (KNIFE) typically includes:
- Summary (`index.md`)
- One or more problem/solution pages (e.g., `how-to.md`, `script.md`)
- Supporting diagrams (`/static/img/diagrams`)
- Tags and metadata (`frontmatter`)

You can contribute in multiple languages, e.g.:
- `docs/en/` – English version
- `docs/sk/` – Slovak version
